<h2>How the Internet Works</h2>
    <font size="+0.5"><p>The internet works by connecting devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets together through a network of servers, routers, and switches. </p>
    <p>When you type a web address or URL into a browser, your device sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server that maps the URL to an IP address. The IP address identifies the server hosting the website you want to visit. </p>
    <p>The request then moves through a series of routers and switches across the internet to reach the server. The server then retrieves the page or content you requested and sends it back to your device through the same network of routers and switches. </p>
      <p>This process of requesting, routing, and retrieving data happens millions of times every second across the internet, allowing people all over the world to access and share information.</p>
