<h2>Dead Cells</h2>
<p>In Dead Cells, players assume the role of a sentient mass of cells that controls the body of a nameless warrior revived from the dead. As players navigate the game’s procedurally generated levels, they collect weapons, power-ups, and abilities that aid them in combat. The game’s difficulty is high, and death is permanent, meaning that failure will require players to start the game anew.

    <p>Dead cells was an enjoyable game that had a lot to offer in the metroidvania game scene. its artstyle was indifferent from most other metroidvanias but the game itself had clean mechanics and ran well. The game however was unclear in the path to take and i often got lost but the best metroidvanias always do, 7.5/10</p>
