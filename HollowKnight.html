<p>In Hollow Knight the player becomes a walking shadow under a shell with the ability to learn skills or find items to help him throughout the journey. With the help of many npcs and wandering for hours the player has fun in battling difficult bosses that eventually enrage the player walking back, fighting, dying and repeating. Hollowknight is incredibly difficult but oh so satisfying when you smash a boss out and reap the rewards. After much time the player finds himself against the hollow knight himself and here there are four endings with one taking on the role of the hollowknight and sealing away the infection.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight is one of my favourite games ever due to the difficulty of the gameand the stunning aesthetics, 9.5/10</p>
