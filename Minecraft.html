<hr> Minecraft is more than a silly little block game. I've been playing Minecraft since January 2020, so I've seen some major updates for the game. The game offers "Infinite wonders and endless possibilities" Minecraft isn't actually infinite or endless, but it might as well be due to the large amount of things you can do with the game. My favorite parts of the game are survival and hardcore singleplayer, and survival multiplayer. Minecraft may seem simple at first, but there are a lot of mechanics under the hood and there are ways to manipulate the game in unintended ways. Multiplayer is another big part of Minecraft, where I play on many different servers with friends and family. There are a lot Multiplayer servers, such as Hypixel and PvP Legacy. My favorite is Hypixel, since it provides a variety of games such as bedwars and skywars. In summary, Minecraft is a game that is definitely worth a try, and is more than a simple little block game. I would rate this game a 8/10.
