<h2>Evolution of the webpage Interface designs used for websites development</h2>
    <font size="+0.5"><p>The 1990s introduced the first websites and had limited design elements; they had only a few images and mostly were text based. Early websites did not have a standard layout and most code was set out in Html coding language</p>
<p>The 2000s introduces more advanced images and tables as well as animated gifs. Overall good design elements were introduced as well as flash animations for more interactive animations. The use of java script was increased allowing for more interactivity on websites, and navigation menus became more standardized on websites.</p>
   <p>The 2010s introduced user interface and user experience design. The rise of social media allowed access to sharing and more simple and minimalistic designs became more prominent and popular. Multiple webpages were developed and the introduction of flat design and bold typography became more popular. The incorporation of mobile able design allowed for mobile accessible interconnections so phone could access these webpages</p> 
 <p>The 2020s introduced accessibility for users with disabilities and the incorporation of dark modes and personalized experience tailored for users, overall making user experience better. Minimalism is as popular as ever though designers are experimenting with bold colo
rs and gradients. This time ultimately leads to more viewer experience and user creations and reliance to further develop websites of the future.
